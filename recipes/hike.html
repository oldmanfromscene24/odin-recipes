    <h2>How to be sure to fail an hike!</h3>
    <p>The recipe for a sure hiking disaster!<br>
        It works best near winter solstice, when there's not much daylight!<br>
        It works even better it is on a wild place and if you are with friends to share the pain!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="odd">A mountain</li>
        <li>Some hiking trail</li>
        <li class="odd">As much D+ and D- as possible</li>
        <li>No maps</li>
        <li class="odd">No gps</li>
        <li>No previous study</li>
        <li class="odd">(optional) a couple of friends</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li class="odd">Start the hike late, since "it's short"</li>
        <li>Park far away, at least 1 hour of walk, from the starting point, since the road to the parking is too ruined</li>
        <li class="odd">Aim for a mountain and climb it</li>
        <li >At the top, aim for another mountain and climb it, since "there's still time"</li>
        <li class="odd">Go to the parking with complete darkness, since "it has only a way out that goes to the car"</li>
        <li>Realize that the last car on the parking goes away from another exit, 
            completely opposite to the other, that you hadn't seen, since it' dark</li>
        <li class="odd">Enjoy choosing where to go and find your car!</li>
    </ol>
